# Usage

### Save Project

You can save the current project in the manager at any time. You just need to type a name. It even suggest you _automatically_ :)

### Edit Projects

For easier customization of your project list, you can edit the `projects.json` file directly inside **Code**. Just execute `Project Manager: Edit Projects` and the `projects.json` file is opened. Simple as this:

```json
[
    {
        "label": "Pascal MI",
        "description": "c:\\Users\\Alessandro\\Documents\\GitHub\\pascal-menu-insight"
    },
    {
        "label": "Bookmarks",
        "description": "c:\\Users\\Alessandro\\Documents\\vso\\vscode-bookmarks"
    }
]
```

> Be sure that the JSON file is well-formed. Otherwise, **Project Manager** will not be able to open it, and an error message like this should appear. In this case, you should use the `Open File` button to fix it.

## Available settings

#### Sort the Project List

Allow you to choose how the projects are sorted in **List Projects** command. You can choose:

* **Saved**: The order that you saved the projects
* **Name**: The name that you typed for the project
* **Path**: The full path of the project

```
"projectManager.sortList": "Name"
```

#### Indicate Code path

Use this if switching projects is not working:

* In **Windows**, simply define the `Code.cmd` path  

```
// For Windows, use:
"projectManager.codePath": "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft VS Code\\Bin\\Code.cmd"
```

* In **Mac OS X**, first try the same **Windows** approach. 

```
// For OS X, use:
"projectManager.codePath": "/Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app"
```

* If you don't have success, try defining the combination below: 

```
// Define to use the alternative approach
"projectManager.useAlternativeMacOSXPath": "true"

// - For Code Stable Build, use this:
"projectManager.codePath": "com.microsoft.VSCode"

// - For Code Insider Build, use this:
"projectManager.codePath": "com.microsoft.VSCodeInsiders"
```

#### Open a New Window

Define if you want to open a New Window or just switch the current 
_(default is `true`)_ . In Mac OS X, it has no effect _(for now)_, working as `true`.

```
"projectManager.openInNewWindow": true
```
